# Movie_Recommendation_System

This repository contains a Movie Recommendation System implemented as the project of the ID2221 Data Intensive Computing course of KTH MSc Machine Learning programme.  

The system is mainly implemented in Apache Spark, along with the usage of several suggested methods as the Alternating Least Squares algorithm (serving as a baseline method) and clustering algorithms 
such as k-means clustering and Self-Organizing maps.

A lot work for the baseline model and setting up the original engine has been based on the work of [Jose A Dianes](https://github.com/jadianes/spark-movie-lens), you should check out his repo and his two related articles that [build a recommendation model](https://www.codementor.io/jadianes/building-a-recommender-with-apache-spark-python-example-app-part1-du1083qbw) along with a [RESTful service](https://www.codementor.io/jadianes/building-a-web-service-with-apache-spark-flask-example-app-part2-du1083854).
